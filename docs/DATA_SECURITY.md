# Data Security in SEO Analyzer

This document outlines the data security practices and protections implemented in the SEO Analyzer project.

---

## 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-Based Authentication:**
  - All sensitive API endpoints require a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) for access.
  - JWTs are signed using a secret key and include an expiration time (24 hours by default).
  - Tokens are verified on every request to protected endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can access their data.

## 2. Password Security
- **Hashed Password Storage:**
  - User passwords are never stored in plain text.
  - Passwords are hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms (Werkzeug’s `generate_password_hash` with PBKDF2 by default).
  - Password verification uses secure hash comparison (`check_password_hash`).

## 3. Database Security
- **User Data Isolation:**
  - Each user’s SEO analysis data is linked to their unique user ID.
  - Users can only access their own analysis history and results.
- **SQL Injection Protection:**
  - All database operations use SQLAlchemy ORM, which automatically parameterizes queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## 4. API Security
- **CORS Protection:**
  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled and configured to control which domains can access the API.
- **Input Validation:**
  - All incoming data is validated and sanitized before processing or storing.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Sensitive error details are not exposed to clients; errors are logged server-side for debugging.

## 5. Environment Security
- **Secret Management:**
  - Sensitive keys (JWT secret, API keys) are loaded from environment variables and never hardcoded in the codebase.
- **API Keys:**
  - Third-party integrations (e.g., Gemini AI) require API keys, which are securely managed via environment variables.

## 6. Best Practices & Recommendations
- **HTTPS:**
  - It is strongly recommended to deploy the application behind HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit.
- **Session Expiry:**
  - JWT tokens are set to expire after 24 hours, reducing the risk of token theft.
- **Regular Updates:**
  - Dependencies are kept up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
